              Taskly is a note taking app made for the everyday user. Its goal
              is to keep your ideas, events, and everything that you want to
              remember close to you. All of this, while delivering a simple and
              easy to use interface.

              For this project, I led both, the user research and visual design.
              I conducted multiple rounds of research to discover if we could
              identify opportunities that other apps might have missed. I
              identified key user groups and key tasks, produced sketches,
              wireframes and prototypes. Validated the hypotheses and iterated
              on the product.

                beginning that there is a hugely competitive market for similar
                apps. For Taskly to be even considered among these apps, it
                needed to be something more.

              <p>
                The very first step of this project was to define who are the
                competitors, it played an essential part of what Taskly has
                become. It allowed me to discover what makes the competitors
                unique, what are their strengths and weaknesses. I found that
                there was no calendar option in competitor's product and decided
                to use this gap for our product.

              <h3>User Interview</h3>
              <p>
                I began to seek out for qualitative data that could support the
                information I already had. Getting insight from potential users
                was the key to determining the MVP of Taskly. Identifying what
                the potential customer already uses. These tests were conducted
                with actual competitor’s consumers and new users that have never
                interacted with any task management app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Qualitative data collection by user interviews was essential for
                this project, it was conducted at nearly every stage.

              <h3>User personas</h3>

                With the user interviews in mind, I started building the
                potential users for Taskly. Discovering their demographics,
                behaviors, needs and motivations helped during the creation of
                the product. It helped me get into the actual user's shoes
                throughout the creation of the app by having a face on a
                potential user.

              <h3>Minimum Valuable Product</h3>
              <p>
                Defining the MVP of the product was necessary to move on to the
                next stage. I laid out every possible feature and selected only
                the one that would be essential to the launch of the product. I
                needed to find which features should be built, what problems
                needed to be solved, and therefore minimized the risk when
                launching the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                The MVP is a very good way to test an assumption when you're not
                sure which impact it'll have on your user base. It helps reduce
                cost, increase speed, so that you can learn faster what actually
                matters.

              <h3>Customer Experience Maps</h3>
              <p>
                Customer chooses products based on the quality of the experience
                they have with them. Being able to visualize a user's journey is
                essential in determining how to make the flow better. Beginning
                with an end goal in mind, I planned the phases the user would go
                through. The map is meant to be a catalyst, pushing the design
                to each phase by highlighting the journey and helping identify
                the opportunities and pain points.

                After having a good understanding of the customer's journey, I
                thought it was time to tackle the information architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                The more intuitive the navigation, the more the user can avoid
                frustration. Starting with a system based on a flat
                architecture, I listed each page of the website. However due to
                time constraint, the site full, wasn't built, only the dashboard
                portion of the product was created.

              <h3>Sketches</h3>
              <p>
                During the first phases of designs, it is crucial to use the
                discoveries form the research phase so that the designs actually
                solve the users needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting with pen and paper is a great way to jot down as many
                ideas of design as possible. It keeps me from getting caught up
                in the technology. Using this technique, it allowed me to take a
                faster approach to rapid iteration before starting digital. With
                feedback along the way, I was able to start defining a design.
                Then taking it in front of potential users to test & and observe
                their reaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sketching on paper is about getting as many ideas down as
                possible without being afraid of making the wrong choice.

              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>
                Once the sketches had a strong design direction & were validated
                through testing, I focused on creating wireframes for the two
                main features of the product. It helped to narrow down the
                design to few variations. Ignoring the visual style of the
                finished product I could pay attention to the placement of the
                element while still communicating enough information to test the
                design with potential users.

              <h3>UI</h3>
              <p>
                Developing the user interface was a significant step in removing
                the uncertainty for the user. It makes the product feels
                finished and increase the reliability of user feedbacks. As UI
                goes, it changes the user experience too. I created the
                interface with a very simple and minimal color palette in order
                take away any possible confusion with the user.

              <p>
                About 15% of the world’s population live with some sort of
                disability. Device compatibility and accessibility is a deciding
                factor when choosing an app. I tested the app with color
                blindness tools and made sure that the values (aside from the
                color) were different to ensure the accessibility of the app.

              <h3>Prototypes</h3>
              <p>
                Once the design was found, the prototype was made within
                photoshop. I started with low fidelity mockups who would then be
                converted into prototypes with limited functionalities. Using
                prototypes were great for user testing because they didn’t have
                the ambiguity of the low fidelity sketches.

                  With the design matured, pushing the test to more users was
                  crucial to find how the customer would interact with the
                  product. Users were asked to complete specific tasks. I
                  checked to see if they encounter problems or experience
                  confusion. These tests were the base of many changes, such as
                  the menu bar.

                The key performance indicators changed as the app evolved. Upon
                initial tests, it was about key user journey, and latter more
                about how many people uses certain features.

                Performing multiple A/B tests to determine whether control or
                variable design is more effective. Combined with the KPIs, they
                were the main quantitative data to backup the changes made
                inside the app.

                While being constantly pushed to my limit during the development
                of the product, it was an amazing experience. A lot of things
                went right, but as any project, things also went wrong.
                Reflecting on these mistakes is a great way to learn and apply
                those learning for the next projects to come.

                <h3>Don't try to please everyone...</h3>
                <p>
                  I learned that you can’t please every user that you encounter.
                  During the development of Taskly I set some wrong expectation
                  from a category of users that I thought could be potential
                  customers until I discover that they weren’t interested in any
                  new application in the first place.

                <h3>Data driven first</h3>
                <p>
                  I also found that feedback (quantitative & qualitative) is the
                  key to a good user experience. Seeing how big of an impact it
                  had on the project, I could have made it easier on myself by
                  gathering more user information in the beginning of the
                  project. Good insight of the data that is being collected is
                  at the heart of creating a good user experience.

                  Last but not the least, don’t dwell on your mistakes.
                  Sometimes the hardest decision in a project is to kill a
                  feature that looked ingenious from a design point of view but
                  never truly translated to the user understanding the feature.
