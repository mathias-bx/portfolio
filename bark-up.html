            <h4>Locating your friends...</h4>
            <p>Bark Up is an app connected to a GPS tracker. The product allows people to track down wayward pets who
              may have got lost, ran away or been dog-napped. It shows the fastest route with a clean, simple user
              interface.</p>
            <h4>My role</h4>
            <p>As the only design responsible for this project - I led both, the user research and visual design. I
              conducted multiple rounds of research to discover if there was a user need for a product like this. I
              identified key user groups and key tasks, produced sketches, wireframes and prototypes. Validated the
              hypotheses and iterated on the product.</p>
            <h4>Challenges & Goals</h4>
            <p>Bark up is aimed to be a safety device as well as tracking one. Both answering the urgency of a lost pet,
              and the need reassurance of their position and health.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create an interface where the user can see where their pets are on a map</li>
              <li>Alert when their pets goes beyond a defined perimeter</li>
              <li>Added functionality like collar ringing and health analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Competitor analysis</h4>
            <p>Starting with a competitive analysis helped me understand who are and who could be the competitors of
              Bark Up. Knowing where you stand with your project is a crucial part of getting things right. Bark Up
              doesn’t have a true competitor, so I looked at other tracking apps, like family & relatives locator,
              running tracker. It helped tremendously to find the right features to build the MVP.</p>
            <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/competitor-analysis-table.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3">
            </div>
            <h4>User Interview</h4>
            <p>After the competitive analysis, I felt like it was time for interviews to research the attitude of the possible future users and look for potential directions. I interviewed 10+ people in different parcs to evaluate the need for the product.  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Most were afraid of losing their pets</li>
              <li>Many were interest about their pet's location</li>
              <li>Some already lost a pet in their life</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/user-research.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3">
              <h4>User personas</h4>
              <p>Based on the field visit, I found that 2 groups stood out: pet owners that are afraid of losing them and professionals pet walkers/sitters. Personas are a great way to design for someone that isn't you. The primary persona here is Ashley. I knew that if we could answer her needs, most users would be satisfied.
              </p>
              <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/primary-persona-ashley.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3">
              </div>
              <h4>User scenarios</h4>
              <p>To bring the personas to life a bit more - I created user scenarios. Scenarios are the story of a user
                performing an action or having an objective with the product. They account for the most popular need of
                the users. Having the user scenarios fleshed out greatly helped with prioritizing which feature should
                be build first.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>“As a dog owner, I want to know when my dog is going out of a defined area, so that I can catch
                  him.” (be alerted when her dog goes beyond a certain area)</li>
                <li>“As a dog owner, I want to know where my dog is so that I don’t have to worry where he is.” (Red
                  route: find pet’s location)</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Red routes</h4>
              <p>Based on my research findings (user personas, scenarios...) I created the red routes. These routes are
                the critical and frequent paths that users take to complete their tasks. Red routes are the fundamental
                journeys that make the product worthwhile. It typically captures 90% or more of the operations of the
                users. It helps focus on the right tasks.</p>
              <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/red-routes.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3"></div>
              <h4>KPI definition</h4>
              <p>Once the research is completed - I started thinking about Key Performance Indicators. They are one the
                safest way to validate a design. Picking a specific KPI is important to learn if your changes actually
                have an impact. I chose 2 tasks, check their pet location and their vitals. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Speed of use (SOU)</li>
                <li>Task completion rate (TCR)</li>
                <li>Satisfaction (% of users who would recommend it)</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Paper Prototypes</h4>
            <p>Building the interface is the “easy” part if you have done all the research first. With my previous
              finding in mind, I started sketching prototypes for Bark Up. I aimed to make the two main paths (finding
              their pet’s when they get lost, and knowing their location at all times) as easy and simple as possible.
            </p>
            <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/paper-prototypes.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3"></div>
            <h4>Wireframes</h4>
            <p>After testing the paper sketches and seeing a solution that worked, I increased the fidelity to
              wireframes - they can be a bit boring, but it does give the blueprint of what the app will look
              like. Some adjustments were made to fit increase the accessibility & clarity of the interface. </p>
            <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/wireframe.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3"></div>
            <h4>Prototypes</h4>
            <p>Once we were satisfied with the layout of the wireframes I increased the fidelity again with prototype.
              The challenge was to keep the interface readable while still giving enough information to the user. I
              had to make sure that the designs answers the goals: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Displaying the whereabouts of their pets</li>
              <li>Alert if a pet goes beyond a perimeter</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/prototypes.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3"></div>

            <h2>Check</h2>
            <hr class="hr-sm">
            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>Usability testing is a key part of understanding the user behavior and creating great user experience. With all the designs ready, I performed a usability testing with 5 users with different background.</p>
            <p>As I already tested the while doing the paper prototypes - I was confident that the flow would work. The challenge here was to find out what we missed, what pain points the users had and possible opportunities. To measure the usability I've used <span class="font-weight-bold">Effectiveness</span> (Task Completion Rate) <span class="font-weight-bold">Efficiency</span> (Speed of Use) and <span class="font-weight-bold">Satisfaction</span> (% of users who would recommend the app).</p>
            <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/user-flow.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3"></div>
            <h4>Key insight</h4>
            <p class="">Good design is assured by both the quantitative and the qualitative way of answering questions. Measuring usability helps validate our solutions and display any pain points that the user could have. Here are some of the insights that were discovered during the usability testing phase:</p>
            <p class="font-italic">Positive</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Get alerted when your pet goes beyond a certain perimeter" was successful when the user had the phone near them</li>
              <li>"Find pet's location" was also successful</li>
              <li>The app being similar to google Maps made the users at ease with the interface</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="font-italic">Opportunities & pain points</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We discovered a need for a walking mode - being able to track your distance and location </li>
              <li>Post-alert notification were sometimes missed (alert being triggered when the user is away form their phone) </li>
            </ul>

            <hr class="hr-sm">
            <p>The good news was that what've build worked and solved the main user needs. But that doesn't mean that everything is perfect or that we can't improve the product. The observation gave us more insights for future iterations.</p>
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Improved notifications</span>: some key notifications were missed by the user - too similar to the usual. They weren't used to the app yet, so they couldn't tell the color change.</p>
            <div class="img-content"><img src="images/bark-up/bark-up-iteration-1.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-4">
              <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Walking mode</span>: some users suggested a walking mode, where they could tack their routes with their pets. They had to use a running app to do that and were wishing that a more "canine" version would be available.</p>

            <hr class="hr-sm">
            <h4>Realistic Project Planning </h4>
            <p>Creating a plan that is realistic is complex, but can be very valuable during the work. For any projects, creating a roadmap to navigate through what can be a foggy route is invaluable. It saves you time, resources and energy.</p>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>Doing research as early as possible prevents issues further down the road. Despite the differences between the users, they mostly shared the same goal: tracking their pets. Understanding who are our users and what are they trying to do is essential in creating great products and experiences. These questions can only be answered by doing user research.</p>
            <h4>Testing, testing, testing...</h4>
            <p>I wished I tested my prototypes earlier. A design exposed to different users (with their opinions, experiences, and criticisms) will unveil multiple problems that you’ll have to solve, ultimately creating a better solution.</p>
